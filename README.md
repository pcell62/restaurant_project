This website has many features including making reservations, placing orders, posting queries and admin dashboard.

The admin dashboard can only be accessed by going to the footer and clicking on the admin login button and entering a secret key.
This dashboard provides seamless management experience.

When opening for the first time, and making reservation or ordering, please give the website some time as the backend may be dormant.
